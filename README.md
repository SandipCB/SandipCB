## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

<p align="justify">

I'm Sandip Chakraborty. Recently, I've completed my BSc in CSE from Lead
ing University. I want to mention that I'm not yet certified officially because 
my final project defence is yet to be completed. I'm always passionate 
about and dedicated to my work. I'm a project-type learner, and that's 
why I've had no issues learning anything new. Besides my enthusiasm for 
learning anything new, I enjoy teaching as well. Also, I'm serious about my 
UX/UI design and web development. So, if I get any chance to join any of 
the related fields, I'll be glad to do so.
 I‚Äôve made 5 projects in C, 3 projects in Java, and one small basic project in 
Python.
 In my 3rd year project, I've worked in robotics using hardware, multi-sim, 
and Arduino.
 I've also done one science fair project with my team in our secondary level, 
where we got the first prize and were nominated for division level.
 Recently, I've been working in the web development field. I did my final web 
development project and started my favorite passion, UI/UX design.
